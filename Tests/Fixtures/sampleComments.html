                              I don't know Ruby, but I think that
                              your code doesn't work properly. It
                              will count the karma score for every
                              comment on the comments page. This
                              includes the comment that you are
                              replying to. I believe that you
                              should have checked the author name
                              somewhere before you added to the
                              karma HashMap.

                              If there is not, then I can create
                              something on github pages that should
                              do this. It should be fairly simple
                              to do and would just involve scraping
                              the data in the <a href=
                              "http://lesswrong.com/user/[specifiedUser"
                              rel=
                              "nofollow">http://lesswrong.com/user/[specifiedUser</a>]/comments/
                              pages. I think this is the only way
                              to do it. Let me know what you want
                              and I will look into it. I could
                              probably also include your posts
                              karma and allow you to check how your
                              karma score changes over time.

                        A book on botany with great pictures I
                        already gave her, and her relatives read to

                        can use which are much better than anything

                              The book sounds good. I think
                              ultimately there are two things that
                              are important here: the first is
                              teaching her about botany and the
                              second is to instill and build on her
                              drive to want to learn the material
                              or more broadly a problem
                              solving/curious mindset. In my
                              opinion, the second one is more
                              important.

                              Two pieces of advice:

                              <li>Forget about the structure. Just
                              think about setting up an environment
                              that will <a href=

                                plant for her room would be a good
                                idea.

                              you can do, I reckon, is to take her
                              outside and <a href=

                                Botany, but I think it would be
                                cool, as an example, if you picked
                                up a flower and pointed out to her
                                that most people are born with two
                                arms and then asked: “So, would
                                that mean that the amount of petals
                                on this type of flower will all be
                                the same”. Then, no matter what she
                                says you can go to a group of the
                                flowers and let her count the
                                amount of petals to see if they’re
                                the same. Then, you can ask another
                                question: are the buds the same
                                etc.

                        <p>
                          It looks to me like it's possible to
                          resist grief, at least to some extent. I
                          think people do it all the time. And I
                          think it's an error to do so.

                      <p>
                        It is only an error if it continues on too
                        long. Avoidance in most circumstances is a
                        natural and innate part of the process of
                        dealing with grief.
                      </p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p>
                          Avoidance is sometimes an adaptive
                          strategy in coping with adversity and
                          sometimes maladaptive. In the case of
                          bereavement, experiential avoidance
                          usually plays a role in facilitating the
                          healing process. The emotional pain
                          associated with new information that a
                          loved one has died is so severe that
                          people need time interspersed with
                          periods of respite in order to be able to
                          fully acknowledge the unwanted reality.
                          Respite can be achieved using cognitive
                          avoidance, and sometimes by also avoiding
                          contact with triggers of emotion. When
                          avoidance is used adaptively, it
                          facilitates processing of the painful
                          information as well as restoration of the
                          capacity for a satisfying ongoing life.
                          As processing and restoration are
                          achieved, the need for avoidance
                          diminishes and the strategy must be
                          relinquished. If it is not, or if
                          avoidance is over-used in the wake of
                          bereavement, the strategy can backfire.
                          Processing difficult information is
                          impeded rather than facilitated and acute
                          grief is prolonged. <a href=

                        This sounds potentially dangerous to me.
                        You could easily retraumatize yourself or
                        deepen your grief by doing this. It is
                        probably best to try to do this when with
                        someone else and also not too early in the
                        grief process. This does not mean that you
                        should never do this, however, as this is
                        something that has to happen eventually.

                        The feelings from grief have an undulating
                        or wave like motion. There will be times
                        where you can face your feeling and times
                        when you cannot. This is totally fine. It
                        does, however, become important as more
                        time progresses for you to make sense of
                        the loss and find benefit in it, which
                        fortunately often becomes easier as time
                        progresses:

                          Those who were able to make sense of
                          their loss typically did so by seeing the
                          death as predictable or as a natural
                          condition of life or by suggesting that
                          the death was comprehensible within the
                          context of their religious or spiritual
                          beliefs. On the other hand, those who
                          were able to find benefit in the
                          experience tended to report that they had
                          learned something important from it,
                          about themselves (e.g., that they had the
                          strength to cope with the adversity),
                          about others (e.g., the value of family
                          and relationships), or about the meaning
                          of life (e.g., learned what is important
                          in life). <a href=

                        I think the power from this actually comes
                        from the perspective that you are taking on
                        the loss rather than the simple fact that
                        you are thinking about it. For example, I
                        think there was a big benefit from not
                        thinking about how unfair it was.

                      <p>
                        tldr; I’ve created a simple value
                        management system with reflective elements
                        to begin overhauling my previous self, and
                        it’s going great! Yahoo!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Context: I was a person with various
                        non-productive behaviors who was highly
                        compassionate, and luckily noticed Less
                        Wrong. Took a long time to make what didn’t
                        feel like progress; but recently I’ve been
                        in a better state of mind, and decided to
                        initiate a system to overhaul myself with.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Thus I created what I indulgently call my
                        Value Management System. Very fancy for a
                        collection of Word Documents on my desktop,
                        ho-ho! Firstly; the whole system dates and
                        records everything, so I can track my
                        progress reliably. There are also
                        procedures for watching performance of
                        everything, and making changes when
                        appropriate (this also dated/recorded of
                        course). First step to pumping actionable
                        values out of myself is the Wish List,
                        which has a short list of whimsical
                        maybe-later things, as well as a more
                        elaborate list of values that are not
                        already implemented (and that I’m not
                        allowed to act on in a complex fashion).
                        The list uses a set of filters to force me
                        to be coherent about a given desire, and to
                        ensure it is reliably actionable and safe.
                        The values are moved to either a Main or
                        Local document depending on my time
                        estimate. So now I have a system for
                        managing myself in a clear and concise
                        fashion! This is a considerable improvement
                        for someone who had the sorts of issues I
                        did. Some of the procedures are becoming
                        second-nature, slowly, and I hope this will
                        greatly speed up my attempts to get close
                        to auto-strategic movement.

                        provided internet. Noticed several issues
                        with values and goals that were handily
                        taken care of. Provided framework to set up
                        more frameworks, like Cognitive Trigger
                        Training, and study frameworks for when I
                        decide what to do with myself.

                        I am so very excited to have this up and
                        running; a major aspect is not losing track
                        of values and actions, thusly fumbling
                        about horribly, gehh. The only drawback
                        I’ve encountered is trying to apply
                        <em>everything</em> through the system.
                        Most things are nearly complete, however,
                        and once the bulk of my foundations are
                        down things will become less congested.

                              This sounds awesome and it looks like
                              it is helping you to become less
                              wrong. I have a couple questions. In
                              summary, the idea that it is
                              implemented with word documents
                              sounds cumbersome to me. I wonder if
                              there is a better way to do it:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>have you looked into any apps
                              that could do what you are doing with
                              a collection of word documents? If
                              you have, then what is different
                              about your system than the other
                              existing apps.
                              </li>
                              <li>What would a perfect app
                              implementation be of your Value
                              management system?
                              </li>
                              <li>have you done much research to
                              create this system because it sounds
                              like the above would be good for a
                              main post if you have. I would like
                              to know about what your set of
                              filters are and what you mean by the
                              framework to set up more frameworks.

                        and that it’s time now to integrate it into

                      <p>
                        But most of the times that I've cycled
                        intermittently into despair over some
                        project (or relationship), it's been
                        because of facts I already knew,
                        consciously, about the project. I'm just
                        becoming re-focused on them. And I wouldn't
                        be surprised if things like low blood sugar
                        or anxiety spilling over from other areas
                        of my life are major causes of some Fact X
                        seeming far more gloomy on one particular
                        day than it did just the day before.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And similarly, most of the times I cycle
                        back <em>out</em> of despair, it's not
                        because of some new information I learned
                        or an update I made to my plans. It's
                        because, e.g., I went to sleep and woke up
                        the next morning and things seemed okay
                        again. Or because my best friend reminded
                        me of optimistic Facts Y and Z which I
                        already knew about, but hadn't been
                        thinking about.

                              I think this is a good point.
                              Despair, which I see as perceived
                              hopelessness, originates in an
                              individual and so it depends on how
                              that individual perceives the
                              situation. Perception is not like
                              receiving a reflection of the world
                              in the mind. It is like meshing
                              together the neural activity from
                              percepts with the existing neural
                              activity ongoing in the brain. The
                              result is that it is context
                              dependent. It is affected by priming
                              and emotions, for example.

                              I think the advice in this post,
                              essentially embrace despair, isn't
                              probably that helpful. What do you
                              think about this advice: "Notice
                              despair for it is a signal of
                              hopelessness. It indicates that you
                              may be stuck in a mental rut or that
                              the way that you are viewing a
                              situation may be inducing unnecessary
                              anxiety. In summary, it tells you to
                              rethink how you are trying to solve
                              the problem that you are facing. The
                              first thing you should do is check
                              that it is real. Get advice and talk
                              to others about it. Try to get out of
                              your head. Also, try and find out if
                              it is misattributed. It may be due to
                              low blood sugar or anxiety spilling
                              over from other parts of your life,
                              for example. If you have done this
                              and now know that the despair is
                              real, i.e. resulting from a complex
                              problem that matters to you and that
                              you can't solve, then try to
                              understand the problem you are facing
                              and your plan to solve it. Once you
                              are happy with the plan then you can
                              embrace the incoming depression. Do
                              not view it as anathema, but instead
                              as your body's mechanism to move you
                              into the necessary focused and
                              analytical state that you need to be
                              in to be able to solve the complex
                              problem that you are facing".

                        The sense that I've gotten (from my own
                        experience, from anecdotes about startup
                        founders, and from some of Anna's examples)
                        is that there's not much distinction
                        between "falling" and "trough," or between
                        "rising" and "peak." We're looking at a
                        phenomenon of RAPID, LARGE swings, such
                        that you're basically at one place one day,
                        and in a completely different one the next
                        (not that the shifts happen daily—just that
                        they're abrupt).

                        In other words, the way we chose to
                        describe it might make it seem like there's
                        a larger distinction, there, but I think
                        what you're labeling "peaks" and "troughs"
                        are actually the same places we were trying
                        to talk about.

                              Melancholia, mania and severe
                              depression might be a bit different,
                              but with normal episodes I think the
                              upswing is when you are solving
                              problems without issues. The turning
                              point at the top is when you come
                              across a complex problem which
                              matters to you and that you are
                              unable to solve. The downswing and
                              slide into depression is your body’s
                              way of moving into a kind of
                              analytical mode. Like fever is
                              induced to fight infection,
                              depression is induced to fight
                              despair. I think that despair is
                              separate to the depression. It is the
                              perceived lack of control over
                              negative events, we often call it
                              hopelessness. Depression, on the
                              other hand, is the induced state of
                              mind.

                            <p>
                              The reason why such mood swings as
                              you describe might happen with
                              startup founders, for example, is
                              that they face complex problems that
                              they care deeply about and that have
                              high social costs if they fail at
                              them. The idea I am presenting here
                              gets to be quite complicated in
                              practice because the cause of the
                              depression is the perceived
                              complexity of the problem, perceived
                              ability to solve it and perceived
                              social costs with failing. These all
                              depend on the perceiver and we don't
                              see the world as it is, we see they
                              world as we are. It is possible that
                              someone might slide into depression
                              because of misttributed emotions,
                              wrong beliefs etc.

                              Depression might also be too strong a
                              word. Perhaps, 'sad' is better. I
                              don't know. I am referring to
                              'depression' as the down ward
                              sections in your mood swings figure.

                            <p>
                              I am basing what I wrote above on my

                              makes sense if you believe the

                              Depressed Affect. The analytical
                              rumination (AR) hypothesis proposes
                              that depressed affect is triggered by
                              problems: (1) that are complex
                              (analytically difficult); and (2)
                              that affected fitness in evolutionary
                              environments. [...] One effect of sad
                              or depressed mood is to promote an
                              analytical reasoning style in which
                              greater attention is paid to detail
                              and information is processed more
                              slowly, methodically, thoroughly, and
                              in smaller chunks [...] Complex
                              social problems may be the primary
                              evolutionarily relevant trigger of
                              depression in human beings
                              </li>
                              <li>Depression coordinates a suite of
                              changes in body systems that promote
                              rumination, the evolved function of
                              which is to analyze the triggering
                              problem. [...]Analysis is time
                              consuming and requires sustained
                              processing, so it is susceptible to
                              disruption, which interferes with
                              problem-solving. Depression induces
                              changes in body systems, producing
                              effects that facilitate analytical
                              rumination by reducing disruption
                              [...]Specifically, depressed affect:
                              (1) activates neurological mechanisms
                              that promote attentional control,
                              which gives problem-related
                              information prioritized access to
                              limited processing resources and
                              makes depressive rumination
                              intrusive, persistent, resistant to
                              distraction, and difficult to
                              suppress; (2) induces anhedonia,
                              which reduces the desire to think
                              about and engage in hedonic
                              activities that could disrupt
                              problem-related processing; and (3)
                              promotes psychomotor changes that
                              reduce exposure to stimuli that could
                              disrupt processing (e.g., desire for
                              social isolation, loss of appetite).

                                  Over evolutionary time,
                                  depressive rumination often
                                  helped people solve the problems
                                  that triggered their episodes
                                  [...] Like fever, then, the
                                  impairments associated with
                                  depression are usually the
                                  outcome of adaptive tradeoffs
                                  rather than disorder. For
                                  instance, because processing
                                  resources are limited, a
                                  decreased ability to concentrate
                                  on other things is a necessary
                                  tradeoff that has to be made in
                                  order to sustain analysis of a
                                  complex, depressogenic problem
                                  The fourth claim is that
                                  depression reduces accuracy on
                                  laboratory tasks because
                                  depressive rumination takes up
                                  limited processing resources
                                  [...]In summary, studies of
                                  clinical, subclinical, and
                                  experimentally induced depression
                                  all show that when given a
                                  laboratory task, depressed people
                                  ruminate about other things,
                                  which takes up limited cognitive
                                  resources and interferes with
                                  their ability to perform well on
                                  the task. It is therefore
                                  illegitimate to conclude that
                                  depression generally impairs
                                  problem-solving from studies
                                  showing reduced performance on
                                  laboratory tasks. They have
                                  nothing to say about how
                                  successful depressed people are
                                  in solving the problems that they
                                  are ruminating about.

                                    In summary, we hypothesize that
                                    depression is a stress response
                                    mechanism: (1) that is
                                    triggered by analytically
                                    difficult problems that
                                    influence important
                                    fitness-related goals; (2) that
                                    coordinates changes in body
                                    systems to promote sustained
                                    analysis of the triggering
                                    problem, otherwise known as
                                    depressive rumination; (3) that
                                    helps people generate and
                                    evaluate potential solutions to
                                    the triggering problem; and (4)
                                    that makes tradeoffs with other
                                    goals in order to promote
                                    analysis of the triggering
                                    problem, including reduced
                                    accuracy on laboratory tasks.
                                    Collectively, we refer to this
                                    suite of claims as the
                                    analytical rumination (AR)
                                    hypothesis.

                        1) Make the current LW read-only. All
                        content is still accessible, but commenting
                        and voting is disabled. The discussion
                        section is closed as well. Let things rest
                        for a month or so.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        2) Announce that during the next year, LW
                        will have <em>one post per week</em>, at a
                        specified time. There will be an email
                        address where anyone can send their
                        submissions, whereupon a horribly secretive
                        and biased group of editors will select the
                        best one each week, aiming for Eliezer
                        quality or higher. The prominent posters
                        you've contacted should create enough good
                        content for the first couple months. Voting
                        will be disabled for posts, and enabled
                        only for comments. There will also be
                        <em>one</em> monthly open thread for
                        unstructured discussion.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I don't think anything short of that would
                        work. LW's problem is the decline in
                        quality, so the fix should be
                        quality-oriented, not quantity-oriented.

                              I don't see why you should shutdown
                              the rest of the site to do this.
                              What's the benefit of not having a
                              discussion section or restricting the
                              total number of posts? The problem as
                              I see it has nothing to do with the
                              total number of posts, but with the
                              fact that there are not many high
                              quality posts. In regards to your
                              second point, couldn't you just do
                              something similar with the existing
                              promoted section. It should be fairly
                              easy to set up an email address for
                              people to submit potential promoted
                              worthy posts and a group of reviewers
                              who will review, select and post one
                              article a week.

                        That's not the definition of "rational",
                        though.

                        You're basically saying that with
                        "irrational" beliefs one should go meta --
                        look at them from the outside, consider
                        <em>actual</em> consequences and effects,
                        ponder why these beliefs exists... Yeah,
                        sure. Going "Oh, you believe in
                        &lt;deity&gt;, you must be so dumb"
                        <em>is</em> dumb. And yes, "I don't know
                        why this works, but this
                        <strong>works</strong>" is a reasonable :-)
                        position to take.

                      <p>
                        I'm still not sure, though, that by the
                        prediction metric science will look as
                        badly as you hint and religions will shine.
                        Contemporary religions generally shy away
                        from testable (during the lifetime)
                        predictions and for good reasons, too. As
                        to science, I think the distinction between
                        hard and soft sciences is pretty necessary
                        here. Hard sciences live and die by
                        predictions. Soft sciences spin narratives
                        -- just like your friendly pastor next door
                        :-/

                              That claim seems totally fine to me.
                              Inaccurate maps can still be useful,
                              sometimes even more useful than more
                              accurate maps as they can be simpler
                              to use and easier to create. I wrote
                              about that <a href=
                              "http://lesswrong.com/lw/mkh/truth_seeking_as_an_optimization_process/">

                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Incorrect maps can also sometimes be
                              useful. Examples of this are adaptive
                              biases like the sexual over
                              perception bias in men. From a
                              truth-maximization perspective young
                              men who assume that all women want
                              them are showing severe
                              social-cognitive inaccuracies,
                              judgment biases, and probably
                              narcissistic personality disorder.
                              However, from an evolutionary
                              perspective, the same young men are
                              behaving in a more optimal manner.
                              One which has consistently maximized
                              the reproductive success of their
                              male ancestors. Another similar
                              example is the bias for positive
                              perception of partners.

                          There’s a version of you that is good at
                          moving forward—that has the energy to
                          pour seventy hours a week into your
                          current best guesses, stretching the
                          parts of your model that are correct as
                          far as they can go. And there’s a version
                          of you that is good at dealing with the
                          darker side of reality—that is actually
                          willing to consider the possibility that
                          it’s all garbage, instead of just paying
                          lip service to the idea.

                      <p>
                        Interesting idea, but it looks like you are
                        talking solely about the rising and falling
                        sections here. I personally think that the
                        most pertinent parts are instead the peaks
                        and the troughs. What happens in those
                        particular moments and what types of
                        subsequent falling and rising sections do
                        they require or are the best?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Perhaps, the trough must be preceded by the
                        falling section, not only because old
                        models are discarded there, but also
                        because it is the best place for truly
                        innovative discoveries to occur. It is
                        where <a href=
                        "https://www.ida.liu.se/~729A15/mtrl/creative_innovation.pdf"
                        rel="nofollow">arousal</a> is minimal and
                        introspection/inhibition/rumination is
                        maximised. The trough and subsequent rising
                        section, then, is where you make use of the
                        new ideas or paradigms that you have
                        discovered.
